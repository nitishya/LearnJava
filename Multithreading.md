**MultiThreading -**

- The ways to define a thread?
  1. By Extending Thread Class.
  2. By Implementing Runnable(I).

- Getting and Setting name of the thread.
- Thread Priorities
- The Methods to prevent Thread execution.
   1. Yield()
   2. join()
   3. sleep()
  
- Synchronisation
- InterThread Communication
- DeadLock
- Deamon Threads
- Multithreading enhancement


**What is multitasking?**
Executing multiple task simulteneously .
   1. Process Based - Executing several Task simultaneously where each task seperate independent program.   Example: while typing a java program in the system we can listen to the audio song in the music application from the same system at the same time we can download a file from Internet using browser , all these task will be executed simultaneously and independent of each other.Hence it is process based multi tasking.
   2. Thread Based - Executing several task simultaneously where each task is separate independent part of a same program and each independent part is called thread.


whether it is process based or thread based the main objective of multitasking is to reduce response time of the system and to improve performance.

The main important application areas of multi threading are 
- To develop multimedia graphics
- To develop animations
- To develop video games
- To develop web servers and application servers

When compared with old languages developing multithreaded application in java is very easy beacause java provides inbuild support for multithreading with rich api(Thread, Runnable, Thread Group...).
